										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">By: Chilotam Ojukwu</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published: 15th November, 2022</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an African proverb that says; “The sky is vast enough for all birds to fly without collisions”. This directly translates to; there is enough space and opportunity for every person to succeed, without hindering the success of another. And this is very accurate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One misconstrued fact about getting into a more technical role &#8211; such as product designing, software engineering and the likes &#8211; is that it is only for a select few. This is wrong. Often, people may doubt their abilities to thrive in a technical environment because of the gatekeeping that comes with certain territories. </span><a href="https://medium.com/@damngoodtech/how-to-recognize-tech-gatekeeping-and-how-to-ignore-it-or-stop-it-b1c72493f391"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatekeeping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the activity of controlling, and usually limiting, general access to something. In this case, certain individuals may gate-keep tech in general, by limiting people’s access to the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that &#8211; once again &#8211; the sky is vast enough for all birds to fly without collisions. Now, what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a technical role? What </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a non-technical role? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/technical-position#:~:text=Related%20Definitions&amp;text=Technical%20position%20means%20a%20position,on%2Dthe%2Djob%20training."><span style="font-weight: 400;">technical role</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one that requires you to have specialised knowledge in a particular field, to perform expertise functions. The roles could be junior, intermediate or senior, where you serve as a professional in your domain. A technical role or position requires a combination of skills that may be obtained through years of experience in that domain. It can also be acquired by on-the-job training. </span><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/technical-skills"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of technical roles that can be learnt on the job are; Technical Writing, Data Analysis, Project Management and so much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.benjamindada.com/succeeding-tech-non-technical-person-20-experts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-technical role</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one that focuses more on an individual’s communication and analytical skills, rather than their technical knowledge. They also do not require you to have core IT Skills, such as coding, programming and web development. </span><a href="https://degreesandcareers.info/resources/tech-jobs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of non-technical roles (in and out of tech) that can also be learnt on the job are Product Marketing, Digital Marketing, Sales Development, Human Resources and so much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is gradually becoming more digital and technology has made all our lives easier. This has also made many people reconsider their career choices and even contemplate changing career paths from a non-technical role to a technical role. While this doesn’t apply to every single person in the labour market, more people are being encouraged to get into technical roles, to become a “tech bro” or a “tech sis”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can get difficult to navigate through the different technical roles that exist in the job industry, and it’s ok to take some time and figure things out. If you need some direction on the steps to take to make your transition from a non-technical role to a technical one, you’ve come to the right place! Here are some </span><a href="https://www.comptia.org/career-change/switching-career-path/how-to"><span style="font-weight: 400;">things to consider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when transitioning to a technical role:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Interests</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest plays a huge role in what to consider for your means of livelihood. What interests you? What tickles your fancy? What makes you grin from ear to ear when you hear about it? What do you do effortlessly with little to no support? Those are pointers to your interests. The good thing is, your interest in a role enables you to deliver efficiently, even if you’re new to it. For example, I used to work as a Human Resources Executive. A while later, I discovered that my interest was in being a content and copywriter. I eventually transitioned to the latter and I’m happier with my job every single day. I still have a lot to learn, but my interest makes me more curious and willing to be better at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are interested in certain technical roles such as web development, product design, coding and even programming, you should totally feed into it! How? Start from the basics; reading about them, taking crash courses, taking professional courses, applying them in your day-to-day learnings, joining communities, volunteering in group projects and finally, job hunting. Gathering the necessary skills for your interests gives you a competitive edge over others, especially as a beginner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, the internet has so much free information that you can leverage. So, identify your interests and passion, then take it up from there. Of course, this requires you to create time for learning, especially if you have other commitments. The key to all of this is balance.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Monetise Your Passion</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t particularly have to get into tech to make </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cool cash</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or transition to something more technical. For example, if you are into videography, photography or even YouTube, more of your skill sets will be lined towards using filming equipment, working light setups and even learning about angles. There is so much that goes into it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monetising your passion or interests simply means finding ways to make money or profits from them. On the other hand, if more of your technical skills are IT related, you can monetise them by taking on private projects from clients. You build your network by associating with tech communities, attending tech events and making acquaintances with fellow tech enthusiasts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who is looking to transition to a technical role career wise, monetising your tech skills can also be attempting to gain employment with a reputable company, to build technological solutions for millions of people to use. Most people have a smartphone and interact with technology daily. You can improve the quality of life of many by being employed as an expert in your area of interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also a win-win. You get to do what you love, monetise it and make life easier for your users. What’s not to love and appreciate about that?</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Strive to Improve</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improvement is a given in every facet of life. Without improvement, civilisation would not have come this far. After identifying your interests and monetising them, the next thing to do is find ways that keep you at the top. Learn new ways to implement and execute tasks, stay on top of trends, keep up with other experts in your field and be active in the communities you join. These are ways to continuously improve your skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenging yourself with more responsibilities and taking more professional courses &amp; examinations are also great ways to improve your craft. Over time, you realise how much you’ve grown and in the long run, you can pay it forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to get into a technical role at work such as coding, programming and the likes, here’s some good news for you; someone has definitely been stuck before. This simply means that all your answers to potential blockers are on the internet. You’re not alone<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">By: Chilotam Ojukwu</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published: 13th November, 2022</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can guarantee you that every Nigerian who has served Nigeria through the NYSC program, understands and has faced the struggles and hardships of serving. NYSC stands for National Youth Service Corps. It is a 1 year program that was designed by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakubu_Gowon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yakubu Gowon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adebayo_Adedeji"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adebayo Adedeji</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to foster national unity amongst Nigerian youths. This is because Nigeria is a large country with many ethnic groups and languages. NYSC was created so that Nigerian youths would be more familiar with the different parts of the country. It is usually done after graduation from the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerians in this program are called “Corpers” or “Corps Members”. Corpers are posted to a state &#8211; usually different from where they are from, where they grew up and/or went to school &#8211; to work in companies such as schools, tech companies, government institutions and so much more. Through NYSC, they can get acquainted with the culture of other parts of Nigeria and even make new friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, the unemployment rate is at an all time high, peaking 33% and will most likely increase by 2023. There are many sides to this problem, but two common ones are; </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young people &amp; fresh graduates not being equipped with the right skill sets to gain employment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies having a hard time hiring qualified candidates for different roles. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The period after graduation from school and conclusion with NYSC is laced with so much uncertainty that could drive young people into a potential state of depression. Those who wish to learn on the job and gain certain skills are not able to, because of  “limited resources and opportunities”. Another problem is how companies may not have the bandwidth to properly train and build young people up for the positions that need to be filled. It’s a whole mess with so many nuances and understandable perspectives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the thing, you don’t need to be in a state of uncertainty after NYSC or university graduation, because there is so much to learn that can set you apart from your peers in terms of technical skills. One of the important things to note when it comes to seeking employment is </span><b>skill</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">s. What can you do? What sets you apart? How well do you know your onions? What do you need to make it happen? How open are you to improving and finding better ways to get things done? What </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you done? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skills are so essential for your growth and success as an individual in the labour market. Technical skills show your level of expertise and soft skills distinguish you from your competitors on a more personal level. Luckily for you, I have compiled 3 ways that you can begin a career with technical skills if you are new to the job market. Even if you have no idea how to go about acquiring these skills, these tips will help you have a head start, especially in Tech. Here are a few ways that you can build up your portfolio with relevant experiences in the tech role that you wish to get into:</span><br />
<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Internships</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internships are a great way to start as a rookie in tech because you can gain granular knowledge about the industry you want to work in at a more comfortable pace. If for instance, you’d like to be a Front End Engineer or Developer, your best bet is to apply for internships as a Front End Engineer or Developer in tech companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of things are involved here such as proximity to your home, convenience and how much you are actually learning. In the end, there is one goal; to have experience and learn directly from professionals. You also learn soft skills, because you get to work with different people from various backgrounds. </span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Training</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting trained in the ins and outs of a specialty that you would like to work in may also require you to pay for it. In this setting, online courses are your best bet because there are several affordable courses for beginners who want to break into a career path that they know little about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of paying often scares people away, but what’s the bigger picture here? The bigger picture is the fact that NYSC is borderline frustrating, and that you want to get a good job. Besides, if you can afford to pay for internet services every other week, you can definitely save up for one or two online courses. Keep in mind that a good laptop plays an important role in your learning experience here, so definitely consider this.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Registering For an Academy</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An academy is one of the best ways to kickstart your career in a designated field. Thankfully, there are numerous online and onsite academies that offer to train graduates with the technical skills that they need to excel in the job market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An academy can also provide you with more exposure and hands-on experience with the day-to-day operations of the learning path that you are on. In about 6 months to 1 year, you’re already ahead of your peers. You also have a competitive advantage when seeking employment. The best part is that it could be flexible enough to allow you honour your other commitments while improving yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the good news. You can get all of these &#8211; aforementioned techniques &#8211; in one “package” that has one goal alone; to help you become one of the in-demand tech talents in the job market. The </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NextGen Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has curated a 6 month program that trains you in one of the following areas;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front End Development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back End Development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Design</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all up to you to choose which suits your intended career path best. Instead of basking in uncertainties after university and NYSC, you can utilise 6 months in a year to build yourself and get better at your craft. The academy grants you a certificate of completion upon your graduation and also links you to the best tech communities to learn from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get to be with a tribe of like minds and amazing colleagues who will be a part of your journey and growth. It only gets better from there. Find the details below to </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the academy:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price &#8211; N200,000 ($250) or N80,000 ($100) monthly for 3 months</span></i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">By: Chilotam Ojukwu</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published: 10th November, 2022</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People often ask me, “what exactly is it that you do in this tech?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some vagueness that follows the term “tech”, what it entails, the prerequisites for landing tech roles and other interesting facts about it. </span><a href="https://medium.com/@damngoodtech/how-to-recognize-tech-gatekeeping-and-how-to-ignore-it-or-stop-it-b1c72493f391"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatekeeping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a factor that prevents people from knowing more about tech roles and careers, or how to even get into them. This may be a result of a certain complex or the need to “protect” something that people deem as sacred, for the sake of statuses or classism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatekeeping in tech presents itself in various ways such as;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A “know-it-all” perspective</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A “how could you not know this” perspective</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unwillingness to learn, adapt or change</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple superiority complex</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to educate curious people about my tech job, I try to explain the nature of the job, why it matters, why I take it seriously and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it even relates to anything remotely important. I do this because it is nice to get more people involved in this line of work, so that more technological innovations are made, more people tap into this industry and less people are left in the dark about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people are not aware that you don’t need to perform some magical “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abracadabra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to land yourself a cool tech job, or even know some facts about it. It’s great to begin from somewhere, so here are a couple of interesting facts you should know about the tech industry. If you’re looking to secure employment in a tech company, these could give you an idea of what you’d need, expectations to have  and other basic facts:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>No Degree Needed</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A degree in computer science, engineering or any related field is great, but not entirely necessary if you want to start a career in tech. It is a great starting point, but not the only path to success. This is because there are so many </span><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-need-a-computer-science-degree-to-work-in-tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> freely available now more than ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the interesting things about getting into tech is that you can decide to dedicate a year or less to learning a skill without previous knowledge of it, and you can totally kill it! Most times, people aren’t practising what they studied at school, so don’t let your academic background limit your mindset. Your potential employer just wants to know that you understand what needs to be done, and that you’re good at your job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that as a rookie, you would most likely be learning on the job if all of it is new to you, but that shouldn’t deter you. The earlier you feed into your interests in your tech career, the better you are at what you’ll be doing. As long as you want to learn and put in the work, the world stage is yours! </span></p>
<p><b>2. Early Career Pay is High</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least once or twice, you’ve been advised by an older person to work a job without getting paid &#8211; even if it’s just one time. While the sentiments behind this are reasonable, I think we can agree that it feels pretty good to be paid for a job well done. Because tech talents are in demand, the start of your career usually comes with a decent remuneration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The better you are at your job, the higher your salary will be. This means climbing through the ranks and getting deserved promotions at work in due time. The best tech companies recruit the best and the brightest, so the earlier you get into it, the more time you have to sharpen your skills. Check out the top 5 Early Median Salaries </span><a href="https://blog.transparentcareer.com/college-students/career-guides/5-facts-working-tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Juicy Salaries</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of salaries, keep in mind that money is not the only motivator for getting into tech, but because we all know that truth that we’d rather not say, let’s get into salaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average tech person out-earns their non-tech salary earner by a reasonable margin. So what’s not to love about that? Of course, this is dependent on different countries and how well they prioritise tech roles over non-tech roles and vice versa. The education level of the labour market also plays a role here. Where more people are less tech inclined, those (tech) jobs tend to pay higher salaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trenches are temporary, soft life is the ultimate goal. But, there is no soft life without money, so hold on to that. You can read more about this and compare the salaries of technical positions over non-technical positions </span><a href="https://www.paylab.com/blog/salary-differences-technical-non-technical-positions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Young Workforce</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many young people are interested in tech because they are more interactive with technology; social media, smart phones, computers, etc. There is so much potential in these technologies that can be used to make our lives easier. Many tech companies are run by millennials and many of their employees comprise both millennials and Gen-Z. Chances are, you get to work with your peers and grow through the ranks with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many examples of young people who run tech companies with a young workforce. </span><a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/this-29-year-old-left-his-job-and-now-hes-on-track-to-build-a-1000000-software-development-company/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oladosu Teyibo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a Tech Entrepreneur (and a millennial) who runs </span><a href="https://www.analogteams.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analog Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a successful software company that hires talents from underrepresented communities. Analog Teams has expanded into 6 African countries, some of which are Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-chef-and-cookbook-author-of-plantbaed-to-open-restaurant-following-meal-prep-success/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne Onyeneho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another awesome example of young people who utilise technology for the good of many. Anne is the founder of </span><a href="https://plantbaed.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PlantBaed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a Lifestyle Cook who launched a meal prepping service named after the cookbook (PlantBaed) that she authored. Her customers buy healthy meals from her which are laced with healthy recipes free of additives and artificial substances. How cool is that?! Check out more millennial and Gen Z entrepreneurs and tech founders </span><a href="https://africa.businessinsider.com/tech/meet-the-millennial-and-gen-z-founders-dressing-jill-biden-opening-nft-art-galleries/2w70m22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>5. A Community</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is always a </span><a href="https://thecommunityatlas.com/en/2020/11/16/top-10-largest-tech-communities-in-the-world/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20tech%20community,products%2C%20software%20and%20digital%20entertainment."><span style="font-weight: 400;">tech community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is willing to help and teach tech newbies how to get around their new careers and interests.

								<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_0  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">

<p><em>Published: 2nd November, 2022</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beautiful thing about gender differences is our innate interests for different things; ideas, topics, daily activities and so much more. Engineering and tech related programs, careers and jobs were mostly dominated by men. However, from as early as 1952, women were already into programming. Women like Mary Coombs were employed to work as a commercial programmer on LEO computers, and Ada Lovelace is often called the first computer programmer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now,  women are venturing into tech spaces where they can assume job roles that have, in the past, been referred to as “masculine” jobs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because generally, women are getting into the workforce and picking up interest in being amongst the working class</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We sometimes hear and use the phrase “women in tech” as a form of inclusion, and even for internet jokes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tech industry is now filled with women from different backgrounds, who have value to offer with their amazing skills. From software engineers, to product designers, to quality assurance engineers, you name it! Women are representing. Here are 5 reasons why more women should consider tech jobs and careers:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>More Talents</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need women in tech because we need more people in tech. According to the </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S Bureau of Labour Statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employment in computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 13% from 2020 to 2030, faster than the average for all occupations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two heads are always better than one, so why not? It is also nice to have a variety of personalities with different interests, working in the same industry to achieve a common goal &#8211; to make life easier with technology. </span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Balanced Products</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women make up half of the population, so it only makes sense to have more women involved in the conceptualisation of female related tech products. More insight will be needed from the target audience &#8211; women &#8211; and this ultimately brings the product closer to home. For instance, the Flo App is used by many women for different purposes because it brings them value needed. If more ladies are involved in the updates, changes and added features of the app, it brings the product closer to home and more relatable for its users.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Breaking the Bias </b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of stereotypes emanate from tech roles in general because more men tend to be interested in tech and other “hard core” jobs. This may or may not take some time to change, depending on a person’s immediate environment or region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">31 year old </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/15/how-a-31-year-old-quit-her-150-per-year-tech-job-to-start-an-equal-pay-app.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christen Nino De Guzman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quit her $150,000 job at TikTok to start an equal pay app called Clara for Creators. She did this because she wanted to give more female influencers an opportunity to set their own rates for influencer marketing, without being shortchanged or underpaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the grand scheme of things, women getting trained and hired into tech roles paints an inclusive picture for the younger generation of ladies who wish to start careers in this path. Companies like She Leads Africa and SheCodeAfrica were founded by Yasmin Belo-Osagie and Ada Nduka Oyom respectively. These ladies are the perfect examples of breaking the bias. I</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>More Money!</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is no secret that tech people earn significantly more than their non-tech peers. This is not the fact in every case, but it generally applies to many. Currently, the percentage of men vs. women in tech is 75% to 25% respectively. This gap can be reasonably closed and the percentage of women in tech will increase if more women pursue tech careers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of the money, if more women venture into tech, they will have more resources to fend for themselves, their loved ones and even contribute to the economic and financial growth &amp; stability of their families and communities in the long run. These skills can even be passed down to younger generations of ladies who can make a difference in their immediate environments with these tech skills. For instance, </span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>More Balance</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More women in the workforce and in tech generally creates a balanced environment for both men and women to thrive. In this way, the future generations will easily integrate into their roles irrespective of their gender, because a positive premise for their success has already been set years before them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is worth noting that Nigerian women and by extension, African women, are now breaking the biases by venturing into tech roles. Our parents may not understand the concept of it, but we do. The world has become digital, there’s a need to keep up with tech trends. If you’re not updated, you will be outdated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you interested in getting into tech? Do you have female friends who are interested in this as well? Click </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get started by signing up for the Next Gen Academy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Written by: Chilotam Ojukwu</em><br />
<em>Published: 31st October, 2022</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because our goal is to make you one of the hottest cakes in town, we thought it would be cool to share 3 tech skills that you can acquire, that will help you become a tech talent in demand in the job market. It is very crucial to be gainfully employed, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Gen Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exists to build you up for those opportunities. </span>You can tap into your inner skill sets that can earn you good money, gainful employment and acute problem solving skills.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are amazing opportunities for you to kickstart your tech career in either Front End Development, Back End Development or Product Design. This is also a guide that can help you determine <em>what</em> program to </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Front End Development</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front End Development simply entails the building of the front-end portions of websites and web applications that users typically see and interact with. The daily uses of apps, websites and web applications are possible because of front end developers. They make what you see and interrelate using languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. The design elements you see on websites were done by front end developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FlexceeTech Academy can help you become one of the most sought after Front End Developers in the job market. This means that you can potentially work with tech companies that create products that millions of users interact with. You can become a Front End Developer, with the opportunity to think and develop a product from a user perspective. </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Become a Front End Developer </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">today. You can read more about Front End Developer salaries </span><a href="https://angel.co/blog/front-end-developer-salary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Back End Development</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably guessed it correctly. It is the opposite of Front End Development. Back End Development entails </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">working on server-side software, which focuses on everything that you don’t see on a website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of it like the magic that happens behind the scenes. Many users do not interact with it. In this line of work, you will focus on the pointers, hints and relevant information that make it possible for users to see what they need on the front end. The only difference is that you’re doing it from the backend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon is a good example of Back End Development in action. You go on Amazon to search for a new shirt. A Back End Developer uses server-side language to pull all the information about shirts from a database. That information is then processed in an application and returned to the user through Front End language</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic,  application programming interface (APIs) and so much more. </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Become a Back End Developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today. You can learn the differences between Front End Development and Back End Development </span><a href="https://youtu.be/n_gODKYn9dM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Product Design</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product design is the process of conceptualising the needs of a user, their journey and experience while using an app or website for a particular product or service. Product designers bring these ideas to life by visualising the user journey and experience, pulling it together and designing the product to the user’s taste. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of this is the mobile bank apps that you interact with almost daily. The different steps you take to perform several transactions is determined by the product designer. Product designers also consider the user interface and user experience (UI/UX). The interface of an app or website simply means what it looks like. It encompasses the look, feel, and relatability of a product. All of these are used by consumers who need that product to do something for them. Think about the iOS interface and compare it with an Android interface. They look and feel different to each user, especially based on preference. Your average iPhone has a different interface from a Samsung, that’s the gist of it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Designers determine all of these things with one goal in mind; to satisfy the user. </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Become a Product Designer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today! You can learn more about Product Design </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJ-ERxbYjw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three programs are awesome starting points for you to </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">begin your journey in tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are also very interesting because you get the opportunity to reason along the lines of a user &#8211; like yourself. What is ideal for a website or app? How quickly and easily would you like to perform the actions? What makes the experience worthwhile and what doesn’t? What would an ideal app look and feel like? There&#8217;s so much to do, learn, initiate and execute. The possibilities are limitless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are things to consider when you </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any of the programs that the FlexceeTech Academy offers. </span><a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up and register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for our next cohort in January 2023.

<p><em>By: Chilotam Ojukwu on </em><em>21st October, 2022</em></p>



<p>My African parents will never understand why, as a remote worker, I have to be on my laptop, phone, monitor and in certain work meetings for basically half of the day.<br /><br />“Every time, you are <em>in front of laptop</em>”, says my mum every single day, despite how much I have attempted to explain the nature of my job to her, and that I am required to be “<em>in front of laptop</em>” during working hours. She still doesn’t get it though.</p>



<p>Here’s the thing about jobs &#8211; they vary. From teaching, to being a banking consultant, to being a hairstylist, to being a caretaker, a doctor, and even a full time mum. However, the nature of my own job is &#8211; as the cool kids call it, “tech”. And like every other job, it requires a good level of commitment.</p>



<p>Food for thought, tech is not only limited to the popular career paths we know and hear about such as Product Design, Software Engineering, Writing Codes, Front and Back End Development, etc. It encompasses many other roles and carrer paths. You could be a tech lawyer, or a tech writer, or even a journalist for tech companies. There’s so much to do out there.</p>



<p>Tech is like the new oil in Nigeria. A couple of years ago, being in the oil and gas industry meant you were a big man or woman, making good money. Now, the “good money” comes from tech, and this is not to negate other sources of income that have been proven to be profitable. </p>



<p>In terms of having a white collar job, many people are migrating to this part of the industry, by learning a tech skill or two and becoming one of the hottest cakes in town &#8211; in terms of their skills. I’m pretty sure that this has crossed your mind as well, and you’re not wrong for that. In fact, let me peak your interest and curiosity even more.</p>



<p>As someone who intends to get into the tech industry but doesn’t have much experience, knowledge or even the slightest idea of <em>what</em> it is or <em>how</em> to begin, I have interesting news for you. The   FlexceeTech  Next Gen Academy is a program that is designed to equip individuals that intend to break into the tech industry, with the right skills. It’s everything and more, and the good news is that you don’t have to break the bank to get started, you learn soft skills alongside the technical skills that are taught and you get to start from scratch, as a newbie.</p>



<p>What are these “skills” I keep mentioning? The Next Gen Academy is committed to teaching Product Design, Front End Development and Back End Development to those who are interested in learning these skills. You can become one of those “<em>tech bros and sises</em>” that we hear so much about.</p>



<p>So, who is this open to? I’ll be honest with you, it’s open to those who have the time for it. The program runs for 6 months, after which you will be certified and have a window to begin your journey in tech. What’s the catch? The catch is that you will be taught by experienced experts in their fields who have a ton of knowledge to share, work on real life projects, learn with fellow students in the program &#8211; so you’re not alone, and have enough time to grow, ask questions, make mistakes and learn from them. </p>



<p>Let me address the other question that comes to your mind &#8211; “how much do I have to pay?”</p>



<p>The program fee is N150,000. Before you think anything, just hold that thought. If you can’t afford to make an upfront payment, you have the option to pay in instalments, with N60,000 every month for 3 months. I think that’s fair enough, no?</p>



<p>You and I know that this concept is a good one, so why wait? Visit <a href="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nextgen.seamfix.com/">here</a> to register and get started. You can also contact us at <a href="mailto:Help@flexceetech.com">Help@flexceetech.com</a> if you would like to make further enquiries.  Share this good news with your family members and friends who might be interested. You never know who needs this soap you’re about to cut, <em>lol</em>.</p>



<p>There’s so much more that I have to tell you about the Next Gen Program, so please stick around for the next read with more information and I’ll catch you later!<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
