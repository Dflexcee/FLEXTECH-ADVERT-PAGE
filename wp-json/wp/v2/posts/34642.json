This may be a result of a certain complex or the need to \u201cprotect\u201d something that people deem as sacred, for the sake of statuses or classism.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gatekeeping in tech presents itself in various ways such as;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A \u201cknow-it-all\u201d perspective<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A \u201chow could you not know this\u201d perspective<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An unwillingness to learn, adapt or change<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A simple superiority complex<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@damngoodtech\/how-to-recognize-tech-gatekeeping-and-how-to-ignore-it-or-stop-it-b1c72493f391\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about gatekeeping<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an attempt to educate curious people about my tech job, I try to explain the nature of the job, why it matters, why I take it seriously and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it even relates to anything remotely important. I do this because it is nice to get more people involved in this line of work, so that more technological innovations are made, more people tap into this industry and less people are left in the dark about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people are not aware that you don\u2019t need to perform some magical \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abracadabra<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d to land yourself a cool tech job, or even know some facts about it. It\u2019s great to begin from somewhere, so here are a couple of interesting facts you should know about the tech industry. If you\u2019re looking to secure employment in a tech company, these could give you an idea of what you\u2019d need, expectations to have\u00a0 and other basic facts:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>No Degree Needed<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A degree in computer science, engineering or any related field is great, but not entirely necessary if you want to start a career in tech. It is a great starting point, but not the only path to success. This is because there are so many <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/do-you-need-a-computer-science-degree-to-work-in-tech\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">resources<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> freely available now more than ever.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the interesting things about getting into tech is that you can decide to dedicate a year or less to learning a skill without previous knowledge of it, and you can totally kill it! Most times, people aren\u2019t practising what they studied at school, so don\u2019t let your academic background limit your mindset. Your potential employer just wants to know that you understand what needs to be done, and that you\u2019re good at your job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that as a rookie, you would most likely be learning on the job if all of it is new to you, but that shouldn\u2019t deter you. The earlier you feed into your interests in your tech career, the better you are at what you\u2019ll be doing. As long as you want to learn and put in the work, the world stage is yours!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2. Early Career Pay is High<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least once or twice, you\u2019ve been advised by an older person to work a job without getting paid &#8211; even if it\u2019s just one time. While the sentiments behind this are reasonable, I think we can agree that it feels pretty good to be paid for a job well done. Because tech talents are in demand, the start of your career usually comes with a decent remuneration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The better you are at your job, the higher your salary will be. This means climbing through the ranks and getting deserved promotions at work in due time. The best tech companies recruit the best and the brightest, so the earlier you get into it, the more time you have to sharpen your skills.

Juicy Salaries<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of salaries, keep in mind that money is not the only motivator for getting into tech, but because we all know that truth that we\u2019d rather not say, let\u2019s get into salaries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average tech person out-earns their non-tech salary earner by a reasonable margin. So what\u2019s not to love about that? Of course, this is dependent on different countries and how well they prioritise tech roles over non-tech roles and vice versa. The education level of the labour market also plays a role here. Where more people are less tech inclined, those (tech) jobs tend to pay higher salaries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trenches are temporary, soft life is the ultimate goal. But, there is no soft life without money, so hold on to that. You can read more about this and compare the salaries of technical positions over non-technical positions <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.paylab.com\/blog\/salary-differences-technical-non-technical-positions\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>4. Young Workforce<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many young people are interested in tech because they are more interactive with technology; social media, smart phones, computers, etc. There is so much potential in these technologies that can be used to make our lives easier. Many tech companies are run by millennials and many of their employees comprise both millennials and Gen-Z. Chances are, you get to work with your peers and grow through the ranks with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many examples of young people who run tech companies with a young workforce. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackenterprise.com\/this-29-year-old-left-his-job-and-now-hes-on-track-to-build-a-1000000-software-development-company\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oladosu Teyibo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a Tech Entrepreneur (and a millennial) who runs <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.analogteams.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analog Teams<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a successful software company that hires talents from underrepresented communities.
