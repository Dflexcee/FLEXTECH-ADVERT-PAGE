She still doesn\u2019t get it though.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing about jobs &#8211; they vary. From teaching, to being a banking consultant, to being a hairstylist, to being a caretaker, a doctor, and even a full time mum. However, the nature of my own job is &#8211; as the cool kids call it, \u201ctech\u201d. And like every other job, it requires a good level of commitment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Food for thought, tech is not only limited to the popular career paths we know and hear about such as Product Design, Software Engineering, Writing Codes, Front and Back End Development, etc. It encompasses many other roles and carrer paths. You could be a tech lawyer, or a tech writer, or even a journalist for tech companies. There\u2019s so much to do out there.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tech is like the new oil in Nigeria. A couple of years ago, being in the oil and gas industry meant you were a big man or woman, making good money. Now, the \u201cgood money\u201d comes from tech, and this is not to negate other sources of income that have been proven to be profitable.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of having a white collar job, many people are migrating to this part of the industry, by learning a tech skill or two and becoming one of the hottest cakes in town &#8211; in terms of their skills. I\u2019m pretty sure that this has crossed your mind as well, and you\u2019re not wrong for that. In fact, let me peak your interest and curiosity even more.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As someone who intends to get into the tech industry but doesn\u2019t have much experience, knowledge or even the slightest idea of <em>what<\/em> it is or <em>how<\/em> to begin, I have interesting news for you. The   FlexceeTech  Next Gen Academy is a program that is designed to equip individuals that intend to break into the tech industry, with the right skills. It\u2019s everything and more, and the good news is that you don\u2019t have to break the bank to get started, you learn soft skills alongside the technical skills that are taught and you get to start from scratch, as a newbie.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What are these \u201cskills\u201d I keep mentioning? The Next Gen Academy is committed to teaching Product Design, Front End Development and Back End Development to those who are interested in learning these skills. You can become one of those \u201c<em>tech bros and sises<\/em>\u201d that we hear so much about.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, who is this open to? I\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s open to those who have the time for it. The program runs for 6 months, after which you will be certified and have a window to begin your journey in tech. What\u2019s the catch? The catch is that you will be taught by experienced experts in their fields who have a ton of knowledge to share, work on real life projects, learn with fellow students in the program &#8211; so you\u2019re not alone, and have enough time to grow, ask questions, make mistakes and learn from them.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let me address the other question that comes to your mind &#8211; \u201chow much do I have to pay?\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The program fee is N150,000. Before you think anything, just hold that thought. If you can\u2019t afford to make an upfront payment, you have the option to pay in instalments, with N60,000 every month for 3 months. I think that\u2019s fair enough, no?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You and I know that this concept is a good one, so why wait?
