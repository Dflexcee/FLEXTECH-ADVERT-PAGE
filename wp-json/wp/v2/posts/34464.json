The daily uses of apps, websites and web applications are possible because of front end developers. They make what you see and interrelate using languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It is the opposite of Front End Development. Back End Development entails <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">working on server-side software, which focuses on everything that you don\u2019t see on a website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think of it like the magic that happens behind the scenes. Many users do not interact with it. In this line of work, you will focus on the pointers, hints and relevant information that make it possible for users to see what they need on the front end. The only difference is that you\u2019re doing it from the backend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon is a good example of Back End Development in action. You go on Amazon to search for a new shirt. A Back End Developer uses server-side language to pull all the information about shirts from a database. That information is then processed in an application and returned to the user through Front End language<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic,\u00a0 application programming interface (APIs) and so much more. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nextgen.seamfix.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Become a Back End Developer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today. You can learn the differences between Front End Development and Back End Development <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/n_gODKYn9dM\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Product Design<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product design is the process of conceptualising the needs of a user, their journey and experience while using an app or website for a particular product or service. Product designers bring these ideas to life by visualising the user journey and experience, pulling it together and designing the product to the user\u2019s taste.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of this is the mobile bank apps that you interact with almost daily. The different steps you take to perform several transactions is determined by the product designer. Product designers also consider the user interface and user experience (UI\/UX). The interface of an app or website simply means what it looks like. It encompasses the look, feel, and relatability of a product. All of these are used by consumers who need that product to do something for them. Think about the iOS interface and compare it with an Android interface. They look and feel different to each user, especially based on preference. Your average iPhone has a different interface from a Samsung, that\u2019s the gist of it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product Designers determine all of these things with one goal in mind; to satisfy the user. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nextgen.seamfix.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Become a Product Designer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today!

They are also very interesting because you get the opportunity to reason along the lines of a user &#8211; like yourself. What is ideal for a website or app? How quickly and easily would you like to perform the actions? What makes the experience worthwhile and what doesn\u2019t? What would an ideal app look and feel like?
